Code and data
-------------

- Active learning with multi-state ANI, multi-state ANI model, and gapMD are implemented in the open-source [MLatom](https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom) (version >=3.10). Please see the MLatom page for more details. Links to tutorials are given below.
- All data (training sets and models) will be made available here later. The MS-ANI model for fulvene models is already available in the tutorials below.
