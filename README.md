Code and data
-------------

- Active learning with multi-state ANI, multi-state ANI model, and gapMD are implemented in the open-source [MLatom](https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom) (version >=3.10). Please see the MLatom page for more details. Links to tutorials are given below.
- All data is available in the above repository, with the exception of the azobenzene training set, which is available at the following DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.27024196
